To run it:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

After the required `gem`s are installed, you can then run 

```sh
$ guard start
```

And if you dont have the amazing chrome [plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) installed, you should. 

Once it's installed, open the page in browser, and click the `live reload` button to enabled. You should then see something like this if you have `guard` started:

```
[1] guard(main)> 23:58:49 - INFO - Browser connected.
```
